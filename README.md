# AI-based-QSAR-for-Alzheimers-disease
AI-based Quantitative structure Activity relationship study for Alzheimer's disease project is implemented as part of the Data Mining Course in my Masters degree in AI.
The projects analysis the Quantitative structure Activity relationship of the Amyloid beta A4 protein and the Alzheimer's disease where the activity of the protein is
predicted as pIC50 standard value.

## Implementation Remarks
This project is implmented on Google Colab, the dataset is fetched from [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) in 2021 using the `chembl_webresource_client API` which is regularly updated
hence an image of the dataset is saved for reference.
